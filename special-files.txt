Battery:
 - /sys/class/power_supply/battery
   - current_now: seems to be in milliamps? can be negative
   - status: either Charging or Discharging
   - voltage_now: seems to be an input to the existing voltage_to_percentage,
     down to having similar numbers for almost-empty (3700) and almost-full (4100)

Charger:
 - /sys/class/power_supply/charger
   - online: 1 for plugged in - TODO test if this is 0 when not plugged in
   - type: Mains when plugged in
   - device/chgmode:
     - 00001100 12 when plugged into USB on squeee, in turn plugged into mains
                FAST_CCCV
     - 00011100 28 when unplugged
                IDLE
     - 00000100 4 immediately on replugging, transitioning quickly to 12
                PRE

Backlight:
 - /sys/class/backlight/gta01-bl
   - actual_brightness: readonly, reflects brightness setting?
   - bl_power: 0 for on (!) and 1 for off; accepts 2, gives off, thus not sure of other bits
   - brightness: 0 .. max_brightness
   - max_brightness: the number that's the max usable for brightness

Bluetooth:
 - /sys/class/bluetooth
   - ?

Input events:
 - /sys/class/input
   - input0 -> buttons
   - input1 -> touchscreen
   - input2 -> PMU events

Vibrator:
 - /sys/class/leds/neo1973:vibrator
   - brightness: 0..255, with 0 being off

RTC:
 - /sys/class/rtc/rtc0
   - what's "max_user_freq"?

Looks like ttySAC0 is the GSM modem, and ttySAC1 is the GPS.
