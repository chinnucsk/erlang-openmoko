BUGS
===========================================================================

Sometimes, the alerter appears again after you click accept or
reject. I'm not sure why. I've worked around it in a couple of ways
for now.



TODO
===========================================================================

Make startup sequence more robust: e.g. if sms_manager crashes, when
it restarts, it won't get the registered_with_network event, since
that's already been broadcast. Similarly, if callmanager_gui is
restarted after the phone is already registered to a network, it won't
display the network name, since the event has already passed it by.

GUI for addressbook entry creation/deletion/update

Power management
 - brightness on screen - dim, then switch off

Touchscreen lock
 - use a event-grabbing window?
 - AUX key plus on-screen buttons to release lock?

SMS receive, send functionality
SMS receive, send GUI

Sound support
 - avoid shell-out to gst-launch
 - good internal control of multiplexing
 - use a gstreamer node?

Volume control

Brightness control

GPRS connection

Information on phone status
 - battery levels - DONE, except needs to detect when charger comes and goes
 - bluetooth on/off

Alarm clock



DONE
===========================================================================

Ability to press a key during a call and have DTMF-equivalent sent over the line. - DONE

Information on phone status
 - registered to network? and if so, which? - DONE



TROUBLESHOOTING
===========================================================================

If it starts only when you run it over ssh, ie. over a real network
connection, then make sure fic-gta01 is in your /etc/hosts. You can
confirm that this might be the problem by running "erl -sname foo"
from a terminal window. If it hangs, perhaps a missing entry in
/etc/hosts is to blame.
